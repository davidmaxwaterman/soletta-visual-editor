<!--
Pseudo-menu element to activate the property editing panel.
("Pseudo" because the actual element it controls is not inside
this element. The reason for this is that the property editing
panel has to interact with the "add node" button and the minimap
area during its slide in/out animations. This would be much more
difficult if the property editing panel was outside the layout
element containing the "add node" button and the minimap.)

Three signals are fired by this element:

* nodeSelected (the selected node has changed)
* nodeEditable (requests that the property editor be opened for the
currently-selected node)
* nodeNotEditable (requests that the property editor be closed)

It is initially disabled until a node with editable member variables is
selected.

When a suitable node is selected, and if no suitable node has been selected
previously, the element enables itself, toggles its appearance, fires
nodeEditable (requesting that the property editor be opened).

After the first selection, the user is responsible for clicking
this element to open/close the property editor; at this point, this
element just fires nodeSelected signals if an editable node is selected.

If a non-editable node is selected, this element disables itself
and fires nodeNotEditable.

When this element is clicked (after the first node selection), and if
it is enabled, it toggles its appearance and fires the nodeEditable
signal for the currently-selected node.
